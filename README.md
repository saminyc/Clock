This project is a simple demonstration of how to build an analog watch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The watch face consists of a circular background and three hands (hour, minute, and second) that display the current time. The watch hands rotate smoothly in real time.

Features:
Real-time updates of the watch hands
Smooth animation of the watch hands
Clean and responsive design
Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

How to Use:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser to view the watch.

How it Works:
The watch face is created using HTML and CSS, with the hands represented as div elements. The hands are positioned using absolute positioning and rotated using the transform property. JavaScript is used to update the rotation of the hands every second based on the current time.

Future Improvements:

This project is a basic implementation of an analog watch, and there are many ways it could be improved. Some potential improvements include:

Adding numbers or other markers to the watch face
Implementing a stopwatch or timer function
Adding different watch face designs or styles
Making the watch interactive (e.g. clicking on a hand to set the time)
